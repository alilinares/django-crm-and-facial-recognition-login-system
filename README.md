# Facial Recognition Web Login System
A Facial Recognition (FR) Login System for a web application. 

## Project Description
Current traditional login methods such as credientials are becoming cumbersome to users due to password management, two-way authentication, etc. The addition of a FR Login method for websites and/or web applications can be further secured and reduce the login process by time and steps. 

## Technology Stack
- **Python** for the underlying programming language
- **Django** for the back-end framework
- **MySQL** as the database to store FR Images and Registered Users. 
- **OpenCV** for the FR operations
- **BootStrap5** for the front-end
- **NGINX** for the web server
